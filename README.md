# Image Classification using Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset and Ensemble EfficientNet

This repository contains a project to train an ensemble of EfficientNet models to classify images of pets from the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset. The dataset contains 7,390 images of pets spanning 37 different classes. The images vary vastly in size, aspect ratio, pose, and lighting.
